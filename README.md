## About Url Shortener 

In the web world, using links is sensible, but using long links, especially links to UTM, as well as linking to a specific product site on social networks, can be confusing.
To solve this, sites have been created that give you a short link to the long and original link you have entered.
Here is a simple shortcut link I have written with the popular Laravel Framework that you can easily use. Just make a clone and paste it with the necessary vendor folders on your local host or website.
It should be noted that using a site shortener requires a very short domain.
This project has texts and messages in Farsi that you can easily change in the view folder.
